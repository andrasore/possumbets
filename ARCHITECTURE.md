# Architecture

## Overview

This is a distributed sports betting application built for demonstration
purposes. It uses a polyglot service architecture — NestJS for the real-time
core, FastAPI for the odds ingestion service, Flask + Flask-SocketIO for the
notifications service, and Next.js for the frontend. Services communicate
asynchronously via RabbitMQ fanout exchanges using protobuf-serialised
messages.

## Services

### Edge proxy (Nginx)
Nginx sits in front of the services and does path-based routing only — it is
**not** a smart API gateway. Any service that exposes HTTP endpoints needed by
the frontend is reachable through it.

Responsibilities:
- Path-based routing: `/socket.io/*` → Notifications, everything else → Core
- WebSocket connection upgrade (for the live odds, balance, and bet feeds)

Explicitly **not** responsibilities of the proxy:
- **Authentication / authorisation** — each service verifies its own JWTs.
- **Rate limiting** — handled per-service if at all.

### Keycloak — Identity provider
Keycloak owns all authentication. The realm `betting` defines two roles —
`admin` (gates admin pages) and `user` (default for everyone) — plus two
clients: a public `betting-frontend` (PKCE, used by the SPA) and a
confidential `betting-core` (service-account access to the admin API for
user-info lookups). Keycloak ships with its own dedicated Postgres instance.

### NestJS — Core API
The primary application service. Responsibilities:
- Bet placement and settlement logic
- Wallet / ledger operations against TigerBeetle (in-process module)
- Subscribes to the `odds.updated` exchange and re-publishes UI events to the
  `notifications` exchange
- Publishes UI events (balance updates, bet status changes, broadcast odds)
  to the `notifications` exchange for the notifications service to deliver

Internally the wallet logic lives as a Nest module within the core service and
is invoked by the bets module via direct method calls — no broker hop for
money movement.

### Flask + Flask-SocketIO — Notifications Service
The only service the browser holds an open socket to. Responsibilities:
- Accepts socket.io connections, verifies the JWT on `connect`, and joins each
  socket into a room named after its `sub` claim
- Binds an exclusive auto-delete queue to the `notifications` fanout exchange;
  for each `NotificationEvent` it emits the carried JSON payload to the target
  user's room (or broadcasts if `user_id` is empty)

The service is stateless — no DB, no business logic — and exists purely so the
frontend has a fan-out point that doesn't depend on Core staying up to keep
sockets healthy.

### FastAPI — Odds Service
Lightweight async service responsible for ingesting odds from an external
provider. Responsibilities:
- Runs an `asyncio` polling loop (using `aiohttp`) against the external sports
  data API
- Normalises the incoming odds payload into a consistent internal schema
- Persists current odds to Postgres
- Publishes `OddsUpdatedEvent` messages to the `odds.updated` fanout exchange

> **Note:** This service does not calculate odds. It is purely an ingestion and
> normalisation layer over an external feed.

## Inter-service Communication

Cross-process traffic flows over RabbitMQ fanout exchanges with **Protocol
Buffer** payloads — `.proto` schema files serve as the contract. The wallet
logic is colocated inside Core as a Nest module; bets call the wallet via
direct in-process method calls.

The frontend talks to Core over HTTP and to Notifications over a socket.io
connection (both through the Nginx proxy).

Each exchange is a `fanout` type. Subscribers declare their own anonymous
exclusive auto-delete queue and bind it to the exchange — semantically
equivalent to publish/subscribe: every running subscriber gets a copy, and
messages sent while no subscriber is connected are dropped.

### Exchanges and event types

| Exchange        | Publisher    | Subscribers   | Payload             |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| `odds.updated`  | Odds Service | Core API      | `OddsUpdatedEvent`  |
| `notifications` | Core API     | Notifications | `NotificationEvent` |

`NotificationEvent` is a thin envelope: `user_id` (empty = broadcast), `event`
(socket.io event name), and `payload` (JSON-encoded data the frontend
consumes verbatim). It is fire-and-forget — Core does not wait for a reply.

### Why protobuf over JSON?
- Smaller payload size — important for high-frequency odds updates
- Schema is a first-class contract; breaking changes are caught at compile time
- Faster serialisation / deserialisation

## Data Storage

### PostgreSQL
Owned exclusively by the Core API service. Stores:
- Local user records (id only — primary key matches the Keycloak `sub`;
  email and name are fetched on demand from Keycloak)
- Bet history and state
- Sports events and market definitions
- Current odds (written by the Odds service, read by Core)

Keycloak runs against its own separate Postgres instance.

### TigerBeetle
Owned exclusively by Core's wallet module. Stores:
- All account balances
- Every debit and credit as an immutable double-entry transfer
- Provides strong consistency and crash-safety guarantees for financial data

### RabbitMQ
Shared infrastructure, used as the inter-service event bus (see
"Inter-service Communication" above). The management UI is exposed on
`localhost:15672` in dev (user `betting`, password `betting_dev`).

## External Dependencies

| Dependency              | Used by      | Purpose                                            |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| The Odds API / SportsDB | Odds Service | Source of truth for all sports odds and event data |

## Deployment

Each service is intended to run as an independent Docker container. A
`docker-compose.yml` at the repo root should wire up all services, RabbitMQ,
PostgreSQL, and TigerBeetle for local development.

Suggested repo structure:

```
/
├── frontend/          # Next.js
├── nginx/             # Edge proxy config
├── services/
│   ├── core/          # NestJS — includes wallet/TigerBeetle module
│   ├── notifications/ # Flask + Flask-SocketIO (browser-facing WS)
│   └── odds/          # FastAPI
├── proto/             # Shared .proto schema definitions
├── docker-compose.yml
└── ARCHITECTURE.md
```

> Proto definitions live in a shared top-level `/proto` directory so all
> services can reference the same schemas without duplication.
